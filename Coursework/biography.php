					Palimpsest paintings is a collection of work by a Hampshire artist, with extensive experience of commercial artworks.
					Her interest in art and design was pursued through studying for a BA (hons) Design at the University of Wales, 1993-1996.
					Following graduation a successful career practicing in Interior Design allowed for a combination of exploration of retail
					interior environments and painting. The artist developed a series of paintings for a global retailer alongside developing
					the interior scheme from concept through to implementation. The artist is currently an academic and course leader for a
					prominent Interior Design degree course and is developing research in the field of Adaptive Re-use, which is again allowing
					for the cross over between the interior and exploration of space and form through painting.
