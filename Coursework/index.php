			<h1> Welcome </h1>
			<hr>
				<p> Palimpsest Paintings is a collection of artwork by a local Hampshire Artist and Interior Designer. Palimpsest Paintings
					examine the architectural, historic layers of a building through a process of stripping back. The <a href="gallery.php">paintings</a>
					depict a representation of the marks, scars, textures and colours left behind (shown in the image below).</p>

					class="left">
					
					The work results from an interest in adaptive reuse- the regeneration of existing buildings, and how the biography
					of a building is left within its very fabric. When regenerating existing buildings a holistic set of analytical strategies
					is required to examine its impact, structural changes and histories over the period of its life.
